        "description": "Our proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model classifies Diabetic Retinopathy stages, achieving notable accuracy improvements. With an accuracy of 75.87%, our model surpasses the 75.12% of Harry Prattâ€™s CNN and the 61.27% accuracy of earlier disease-only models. Supervised by Dr. Taskeed Jabid, this model utilizes an optimized multi-layered architecture for enhanced diagnostic performance."
